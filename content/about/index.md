        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Dr. Erik C. Franklin directs the Franklin Lab at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology within the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The Franklin Lab pursues research interests in quantitative marine ecology, fisheries science, marine population dynamics, ecoinformatics, ecological restoration, and invasive species of tropical coastal and marine ecosystems with a focus on coral reefs.</p>
        <p>The Franklin Lab collaborates with the NOAA Pacific Island Fisheries Science Center on population assessment, life history, and essential fish habitat studies of coral reef associated organisms throughout the US Pacific (Hawaiian archipelago, Mariana archipelago, American Samoa, Pacific Remote Island Areas). Other ongoing coral reef projects occur throughout the Hawaiian Archipelago including the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.</p>
        <p>We work with many of the faculty at HIMB, as well as maintain active collaborations with researchers in Florida, Australia, and Colombia. A consistent emphasis of our research is the applied ecological analysis of tropical coastal and marine ecosystems to support sustainable marine resource management using empirical data, geospatial technologies, and statistical modeling.</p>
        <p>These activities have involved collaborations with and support from local, state, and federal agencies as well as national and international researchers to leverage resources and expertise to provide scientifically-sound resource management solutions. If you are considering graduate school or post-doctoral research and our activities interest you, then please read the prospective students and post-doctoral fellows section (<a href="/want-to-join-us" class="badge badge-info">Want to Join Us?</a>).
