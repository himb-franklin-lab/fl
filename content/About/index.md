Welcome to the Franklin Lab!

Dr. Erik C. Franklin directs the Franklin Lab at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology within the
School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The
Franklin Lab pursues research interests in quantitative marine ecology, fisheries science, marine
population dynamics, ecoinformatics, ecological restoration, and invasive species of tropical
coastal and marine ecosystems with a focus on coral reefs.The Franklin Lab collaborates with the
NOAA Pacific Island Fisheries Science Center on population assessment, life history, and
essential fish habitat studies of coral reef associated organisms throughout the US Pacific
(Hawaiian archipelago, Mariana archipelago, American Samoa, Pacific Remote Island Areas).
Other ongoing coral reef projects occur throughout the Hawaiian Archipelago including the
Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. We
work with many of the faculty at HIMB, as well as maintain active collaborations with
researchers in Florida, Australia, and Colombia.A consistent emphasis of our research is the
applied ecological analysis of tropical coastal and marine ecosystems to support sustainable
marine resource management using empirical data, geospatial technologies, and statistical
modeling. These activities have involved collaborations with and support from local, state, and
federal agencies as well as national and international researchers to leverage resources and
expertise to provide scientifically-sound resource management solutions.If you are considering
graduate school or post-doctoral research and our activities interest you then please read the
prospective students and post-doctoral fellows section (Want to Join Us?).
