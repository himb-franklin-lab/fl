        <h1>Want to Join Us?</h1>
        <p>Aloha! If you are a prospective student interested in joining the Franklin Lab, prior to contacting us please read the following information carefully.</p>
        <h2>Graduate Students</h2>
        <p>Attending graduate school is an important decision that should not be taken lightly. Be honest about why you are planning to attend and identify the best opportunity available to acquire the training and experience that will help you succeed in your scientific career.</p>
        <p>If you think you might want to work in our lab, first review the activities and publications for overlap with your scientific interests.</p>
        <p>We are particularly interested in graduate students with prior experience in fisheries science, quantitative ecology, coral reefs, hands-on statistical and field skills, a strong academic record, solid written and verbal communication skills, a love of mathematics, and experience in statistical and GIS software. It also helps to be scientifically curious, self-motivated, and resilient with a good sense of humor. Loving an outdoor, ocean-oriented lifestyle doesn't hurt and will help keep you happy during the challenges of grad school. Surfers always welcome. You must also be (or want to be) a fan of the LA Dodgers. No exceptions. I'm kidding, sort of.</p>
        <p>If you've followed the above suggestions and still think the Franklin Lab at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology looks appealing for graduate school in the Marine Biology Graduate Program, then please write an email that includes your educational background and research experience (a CV would be helpful) as well as a brief proposal outline of the type of research that you would be interested to pursue in graduate school. I get a number of emails so don't be offended if I do not respond immediately.</p>
        <p>For entry to the University of Hawaii at Manoa graduate program as an MS or PhD student, follow the application guidelines at the UH graduate division website. Be sure to also address the specific Marine Biology graduate program admissions requirements including statement of purpose, GRE, and letters of recommendation and indicate Dr. Erik Franklin as one of your preferred faculty advisors.</p>
        <p>If you have applied for graduate admissions, you will typically hear back from UHM by March 15 (Fall admission). If you have applied, but haven't received a decision, please contact graduate admissions.</p>
        <p>If you have received an offer of admission from UHM in Marine Biology, and you have indicated clearly in your statement of purpose that you want to work in coral reef ecology, fisheries, or geospatial analysis, then I probably already have your application. If you don't hear from me, and it's been more than four weeks since you received your admission offer, please send me a brief email.</p>
        <h2>Postdoctoral Fellows</h2>
        <p>Please contact Dr. Franklin directly if you are interested in postdoctoral work in the lab. Note that we do not currently have funding to support post-doctoral fellows.</p>
